The goal of this project was to practice creating responsive layouts using CSS Grid, Flexbox and media queries. React was used to break down the design into small, readable and easily customizable components.

The project uses native CSS variables to make theme colors available in all SCSS modules without the need to use any imports. The result is a pixel-perfect, completely responsive landing page.
